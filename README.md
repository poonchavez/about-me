Hi there, this is Chavez, welcome to my Github profile!

I started this Github page back in July 2021 and I want to apologize that I didn't have any repositories, projects or contributions because I'm a Github beginner and I didn't know how to create the projects and upload them to Github. I'm now trying to learn how to create a some projects including my personal website which is hosted by Github pages.

You are warm welcome to visit my homepage at https://poonchavez.github.io/.

For any comments and feedback please email me at poonlhchavez@outlook.com or poonlh03@gmail.com. 

Thank you for your support and God bless you!
