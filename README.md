Hi there, this is Chavez, welcome to my Github page!

I started this Github page back in July 2021 and I want to apologize that I didn't have any repositories, projects or contributions because I'm a Github beginner and I didn't know how to create the projects and upload them to Github. 

You are warm welcome to visit my homepage at https://chavezpoon.neocities.org/.

For any comments and feedback please email me at poonlhchavez@outlook.com or poonlh03@gmail.com. 

Thank you for your support and God bless you!
