Hi there, this is Chavez, welcome to my Github page!

I started this Github page back to July 2021 and I want to apologize that I didn't have any repositories, projects and contributions because I'm the Github beginner and I didn't know how to create the projects and upload to Github. 

You are warm welcome to visit my homepage in https://www.chavezpoon.com.

For any comments and feedbacks please email me to poonlhchavez@outlook.com. 

Thank you for your support and God bless you!
